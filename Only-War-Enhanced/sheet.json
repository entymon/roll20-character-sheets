	"instructions": "This sheet is designed for use in Roll20. It is based on the Warhammer 40000: Only War ttrpg by Fantasy Flight Games, and derived from the Halo Mythic 3.5 Roll20 sheet made by Omran Losinno and Michael van Weelde.\r\rThere is a universal header that applies to all in-sheet tabs.  This header section consists of five grid sub-sections: first logo and core character details, second characteristics, third Unnatural characteristics plus physical calculations such as movement and carrying capacity, fourth initiative roller and alternate in-sheet tabs, and fifth has all other numbers that should be accessible on-hand by the player such as wounds, fate points, and fatigue.  These tabs are composed of different sections: core character information such as skills and special abilities, a page to list Comrades and the abilities the player may use with them, a list of equipment both used in and out of combat such as weapons or cybernetics, an experience page to differentiate unspent/spent experience points toward an automatically tracked total sum number, a player-kept journal tab to list complete/incomplete objectives in a mission, keep a history of your character's time spent, and track Insanity/Corruption, a tab for characters with psychic ability to show related stats, and a settings tab to allow the player to apply technical changes to the sheet if needed, such as applying an Initiative tiebreaker or replace the character sheet with a vehicle one.",
